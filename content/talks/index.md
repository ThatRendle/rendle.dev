## Highlights

In no particular order...

### Programming's Greatest Mistakes

An ever-evolving look at some of the mistakes in software engineering
over the years that have led to explosions, bankruptcies, world-wide
Windows outages, or in one case just a severe telling-off from my boss :)

### How JavaScript Happened

A history of programming languages, but limited to the ones that
introduced features, concepts or syntax that led to or influenced
JavaScript.

### The Albatross Project

The opposite of
[The Phoenix Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project),
basically. I've started doing it as a one-person play now,
which is a lot of fun.

### The Worst Programming Language Ever

People always ask "Is it JavaScript?" but this is so much worse. It
takes all the bizarre and inexplicable design decisions from a wide
range of languages and munges them all together in one unusable
monstrosity. Also leaves time at the end for audience members to
share their own ideas (and has an amazing comment section on YouTube).

### How Simple Is "As Simple As Possible"

I do also do (mostly) serious talks sometimes. This one is about
unnecessary complexity in software architecture and development,
from microservices (do you really need them) to front-end JavaScript
frameworks (do they really need to be **16 times** the size of
the original Quake?).

## My Speaking Journey

I have done a *lot* of talks over the last 15 years, from local user
groups to international conferences. Here's how I got to where I am.

In the 90s (yes, I'm old) I did
a bit of stand-up comedy, from open spots in pubs to the Edinburgh
Fringe, eventually winning the *Jongleurs/Times Metro New Act of the
Year* competition in 1999 and going professional for a couple of years.
Bits of being funny for a living were fun, but a lot of bits
weren't, and I eventually ended up back in the software engineering
world (although I did get to work as a writer for a BBC comedy show
and I have
[the IMDb entry](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1068222/)
to prove it).

The urge to get up on stage and show off never really went away
though, so when I discovered user groups and meetups and conferences
I had to get up there and talk about something. My first talk was
*Functional Alchemy* and was about some of the interesting and
extremely hacky things you could do with the functional features in
C# 3.0. I did it at DDD Southwest
(which is [still going](https://dddsouthwest.com/)) in 2011, and then
DDD Reading at the Microsoft campus (which is sadly no more afaict).
In Reading, a certain Jon Skeet was in the audience and really enjoyed
himself; I think he lasted about 15 minutes before joining in and
suggesting things. We ended up pairing on a couple of ideas after the
talk and I have to admit, I was more than a little starstruck.

Jon had also been tweeting during the talk, so I came out to find
a couple of hundred new Twitter followers (remember Twitter?), which
was nice. And then he recommended me to a couple of international
conferences,
[Øredev](https://oredev.org/) and 
[Code Mash](https://codemash.org/), giving me a welcome boost into
the wider speaking circuit. At Øredev I met Greg Young and
mentioned having done stand-up, and he invited me to do a talk at
[Build Stuff](https://www.buildstuff.events/) but also asked me to
MC the attendee party: tell some jokes, do some crowd work...

> "What language do you use?"
>
> "Ruby."
>
> "I'm sorry?"
>
> "RUBY."
>
> "No, I heard what you said, I'm just sorry."

...and introduce the musical acts, which chance I leapt at.
That was a fun night.

There was a closing keynote that year, I forget the details, but it
was a very dry, very academic talk and after three days of the kind
of hardcore technical content you get at Build Stuff, it was tough
going for the audience. At some point, somebody tweeted at Greg
*"Next year let Rendle do the closing keynote"*; he asked if I would
do something funny and I said "hell yes" and spent a year trying to
think of something technical *and* funny. Eventually I came up with
*The Worst Programming Language Ever*, which has been preserved for
posterity on
[InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/worst-programming-language/).

That talk went very well and I started getting invited to do it, and any
others I could come up with, at other conferences, and to build a bit of
a reputation for them. Fast-forward to today and I'm practically the
resident "locknote" speaker for the
[NDC conferences](https://ndcconferences.com/), and get invited to speak
at other events outside of my .NET bubble, which is amazing. I'm
incredibly grateful to be in this position, and very aware of the
privilege and luck that (along with a lot of hard work) has led me
to this point.

Anyway, that's the story so far. If you're interested in getting into
speaking I'm always happy to share whatever I've learned along this
journey. You can reach out on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rendledotdev/)
or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rendle.dev), say hi, and ask
for advice or help with the speaking itself, writing abstracts, or 
anything else.
