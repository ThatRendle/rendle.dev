Hi, I'm Rendle.

I build software of all kinds: back-end, front-end, desktop, mobile,
games, CLI tools, whatever. I mostly use C# and .NET but I can do stuff
in JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust, Zig, Kotlin, Python... pretty much
anything. I like to
[talk about building software](/talks/), sometimes seriously,
but often more weird and fun. I do consulting and teach workshops on
things like improving application performance, migrating from the old
.NET Framework to modern .NET, and designing and creating APIs with
JSON or gRPC.
I've been a stand-up comic, a television writer, a Microsoft MVP,
a Docker Captain, and a bunch of other things, and I'm currently
a [podcaster](https://open.spotify.com/show/251OR8a0lxTzpjCwIL44KM),
a writer, and the bass player in the world's premier
tech parody band, [The Linebreakers](https://linebreakers.band).
