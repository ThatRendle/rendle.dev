I should really start blogging again. So I'm gonna.

There's been a bunch of stuff on my mind lately, some of it about
software engineering and architecture, some about life and mental
health and stuff I'm going through, that kind of thing.
So I'm spinning up Hugo, sorting out
some hosting and CI/CD pipelines and all that so I can get it all out
of my head and on the web so you can read it. If you want to keep up
to date there's an [RSS feed](/index.xml) which I'm hoping will go
*ping* at least a couple of times a week.
